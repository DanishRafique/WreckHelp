# WreckHelp
##Introduction
WreckHelp Application and website is an on-road help service provider . Communications technologies — including social and mobile tools — play an ever increasing role in emergency response and rescue efforts, as well as overall personal safety.

With WreckHelp Application , users can contact the local mechanics to fix their vehicle . The user is given a list of mechanics to choose from and they can analyze the mechanics hourly rate and professional expertise as well as other user feedback to narrow down their choice . The application provides the contact details of the mechanics to help the user to further contact the mechanic personally .

India’s daily death toll due to road accidents is more than four times the annual death toll from terrorism. As many as 139,671 people lost their lives on India’s roads during 2014 – 382 deaths every day. The figure is sharply rising every year . The need of the hour is to be smart and take immediate action in case of such catastrophe . When a road accident occurs, bystanders will usually try to help the injured, or at least call for help. In India it's different. In a country with some of the world's most dangerous roads, victims are all too often left to fend for themselves. The WreckHelp Application and website helps the user to contact nearest ambulance service which may help the victims to get the required medical treatment as soon as possible . They can also look up the location of the nearest hospital in case they need all through the map .

WreckHelp also comes up with Police station and Petrol Pump locator to ease the users road travel . User can get the details of the local police station according to their location to contact them in case of any emergency . Refeulling is an important issue in long distance travel and WreckHelp provides the location of the local petrol pump .

The user can also contact the local towing service provider to transfer their vehicle to some other location . WreckHelp provides the contact details , cost of service and user feedback of the towing agency to the user .

Self Help is the best help when there is no help available . The application comes up with a bunch of videos and articles to help the user to fix the vehicle breakdown themselves if there is no other help service available . Sometimes car and other vehicles breakdown due to minor glitches and fault , this section comes in handy in those situation

##Brief Literary Survey and Motivation

When we were coming up with new ideas as to which one will be the best one suitable for our project we noticed quite a few things.Among those one of the most worrying thing was the problems faced by a normal user during an on road journey.Many people face the problem of car breakage in the middle of a highway.At that certain point of time all they can do is to go an search for a mechanic nearby or anywhere located far away.This is quite a tedious as well as a risky thing to do in the middle of a highway specifically during night time.This is quite an alarming thing which has to be treated seriously.

Then after quite a few researches and searching a number of issues on the internet we found out that there was no provision of help for an individual during an on road journey.Even we all face the same problem in our daily life.That is where we came up with the idea of creating such an application which would be of great help to people as an on-road help service provider.We also found out that there was no such application created till date which gave us more confidence in creating such an application which would serve all the on road problems faced by people in their daily life.

Our application which will also be having a website will be providing the users with the numbers of all the nearby mechanics,contact information of the nearest hospital and police stayion as well as the contact information for the nearest petrol pump.It will also be having a provision of self help in case of minor difficulties or glitches faced by an user.The contact information of each police station is collected from the police headquarters and that of the hospitals are collected from their respective websites.The self help section will be having a number of youtube videos which will be available at our specific youtube channel and the rest informations are collected from the internet which we will be in a pdf format.
